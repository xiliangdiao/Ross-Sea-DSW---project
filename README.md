# Ross Sea shelf DSW change project

Ross Sea DSW change in CESM climate change scenario.

A collaborative project to work on the CESM 1.3 climate change simulations. This is a repository where we can work on analysis scripts together, discuss figures etc.

All aspects of the project are tracked through issues. Create an issue to represent each small task. Issues will develop to include discussion of analysis methods and figures associated with each task. 
To start contributing to the code, make your own branch directly in this repository, edit away on your branch, and then submit pull requests between your branch and the master branch (or merge directly).
